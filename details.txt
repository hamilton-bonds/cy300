I would like to detail exactly how we're going to populate the map.

Map is going to be a dictionary.

map_dict = {province1:[city_name,buildings,military,social,economic],province2:...}

province1 = "province name"

city_name = "city name"
buildings = [building1,building2,...]

military = [troops_in_garrison,troops_in_province,attacker]
attacker = faction_name (get faction status (ally, enemy)) OR "nobody"
troops_in_garrison = [inf,cav,art]
troops_in_province = [inf,cav,art]

<unit type> = [num_troops,owner_type,owner_faction,weapons,armor,general]
*(later, we'll have to include total troops for the battle resolution)

battle_constants = [inf_v_cav,cav_v_art,art_v_inf,enemy_attacks_first]
enemy_attacks_first depends on if attacker != "nobody".  If faction_name != your_faction, then enemy_attacks_first = 1

social = [royalty_in_province,rebellion]

economic = [taxes,trade_goods,income,expenses]
